My CS50 Journey: A Harvard Computer Science Overview
What a wonderful chance I have to take one of the top online introductory computer courses.

Harvard University offers CS50, Introduction to Computer Science and the Art of Programming, every year. Nevertheless, many millions of people now have access to the course materials and tools online, thanks to EDX and David J. Malan.

This course teaches students how to approach problems algorithmically and effectively.

The subjects covered include software engineering, resource management, security, encapsulation, and abstraction. C, Python, and SQL are among the languages offered, and students can also choose from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing websites; Java or Swift for creating mobile apps; or Lua (for game development).


Problem sets from the humanities, social sciences, and sciences are included in this course. A final project serves as the course's conclusion. Intended for both concentrators and non-concentrators, regardless of previous coding expertise.


This course has been made easier so that students may easily finish it online in 8 weeks, which is comparable to 2 months or more depending on your schedule or the amount of time you've set aside to complete it. Also, it has intriguing issue sets that will train your brain to think like a computer scientist.

You may either take the course for free without a certificate or spend $99 (at the time of writing this article) to get certified after completing it.

I'm beginning this course as a step in my road towards a career in computer science. To speed up my learning, I'll be taking the course while blogging about it.




This course has an immeasurable amount of my affection, and I will unquestionably finish it. I will pursue certification since I was able to buy it.

You won't regret studying CS50, and it will also benefit you more along your programming adventure, whether you're like me and trying to decide whether to pursue a career in computer science or possibly need to brush up on your understanding of programming fundamentals.
